So the current task that was assigned to me was to extend the custom package that I have created ,So there are multiple things to do such as:
1:To add extra column in the book section but this time  need to make changes in app directory to add migration and not in the custom package.
So that thing is done successfully able to extend the package and add migration to it.

2: The next thing is to create a controller as well as view for extra added field in book section and that is also completed. I have craeted a another controller for it, which basically handle all the edit delete and create features.

3: Third I need to save the database record in a csv file format and create a controller and route to basically download and save the records in the csv file. This is also get completed.

4: At last  we need to read that file and display data in browser so I have craeted a route for it so as soon we enter that specific route It will read that particular data and give us the output in the browser.
